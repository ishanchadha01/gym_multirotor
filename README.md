## Requirements
* Updated testing: `python=3.10` on OSX Monterey
* `conda create -n multirotor_gym python=3.10`, `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`, `python -m pip install -e .`
* Check issues for current bugs



* This package has been tested on Ubuntu 18.04/20.04 with `python 3.8`.
* To install MuJoCo binaries refer [this](https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py#install-mujoco).
* Few additional packages:
  ```
  pip install numpy scipy
  pip install mujoco_py==2.1.2.14
  pip install stable-baselines3[extra]
  pip install gym==0.21.0
  ```
* For troubleshooting refer [this](https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py#troubleshooting)

## Notes:
* Some of the environment parameters have been updated but the task of these drone environments still remains the same as what was discussed in the paper.
* I will keep on updating these codes as I make further progress in my work.
